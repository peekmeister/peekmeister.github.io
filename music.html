					I thought the new Sweet Trip album was going to be the peak of the year, but Tyler, the Creator had to come and show me I'm wrong. Call Me If You Get Lost is great, I'd had it on repeat for days after it came out.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was a huge fan of Scum Fuck/Flower Boy and I was more excited than ever for his next album. I liked Igor, especially as time went by, but I was initially a bit underwhelmed by it because the narrative was so similar to that of SF/FB, being the natural progression of love and loss, but I wanted Tyler to do a hard rap album. And he finally delivered.
				</p>
				<p>
					Funnily enough, I wasn't too keen in the singles leading up to the albums release, as opposed to IGOR where I thought the singles were great and was ultimately a bit dissapointed. But the tone and setting the videos were setting up were perfect, and the opening track, SIR BAUDELAIRE, matched the subtly oppoulent and vintage feels of the roll out.
				</p>
				<p>
					The rest of the opening on the album is full of sub 3 minute songs that makes everything flow so seemlessly and nothing overstays its welcome. There's a clear identity to each song and the features bring their best to the track.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then we get the run of "deeper" songs, beginning with MASSA, which explicitly talks about Tyler's growth as a musician and a person. MANIFESTO has a great feature from Domo MFing Genesis with an old-style OF beat.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then the classic track 10 double song. I actually hadn't realized that the double song on each album has been track 10 on each album until I read a comment about it on the CMIYGL tracklist. But SWEET is a nice song, but the real treat is I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DANCE. Such a bittersweetly pleasant song.
				</p>
				<p>
					JUGGERNAUT has dummy drums. It may be closer to a throwaway in terms of the album's narrative, but it's my favorite. The features from Lil Uzi Vert and Pharrell are primo.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortuntely, I don't really like WILSHIRE (which is like 15% of the album) and closers (SAFARI or FISHTAIL) are passable, but I don't hate them.
				</p>
				<p>
					I did get the cassette box set and it came with a different closer (the aforementioned FISHTAIL) and it's okay. It's no BOYFRIEND, but it's a nice surprise nonetheless.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another thing I would like to bring up is the videos associated with the rollout. They do a good job of setting the tone and look beautiful, from a mix of shot comp, the coors used, and IT WAS SHOT ON FILM. Very subtle detail, but if you can tell, you can tell and it makes a difference. The graininess and overall texture makes the cinephile in me SQUEEEEEM.

						Right now, I am listening to <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sweet-trip/6949189" target="_blank">Sweet Trip</a>. In particular, their new album "A Tiny House, In Secret Speeches, Polar Equals". It's a mouthful, I know, but it's really lovely.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Some key songs:
						<div class="album-recs">
							<ul>
								<li><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/surviving-a-smile/1566025467?i=1566025470" target="_blank">Surviving a Smile</a> - This is a classic alt pop vibe. Play while cruising doen the highway on a summer afternoon</li>
								<li><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/snow-purple-treasures/1566025467?i=1566025817" target="_blank">Snow Purple Treasures</a> - Starts very melodically and carries that melody through</li>
								<li><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/zafire-melts-the-heart-in-modulation/1566025467?i=1566026138" target="_blank">Zafire Melts the Heart in Modulation</a> - This one feels like floating. A lot of the album does, but this one is one of the best examples of that</li>
								<li><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/polar-equals/1566025467?i=1566026139" target="_blank">Polar Equals</a> - Beautiful song, cresendos like heaven. Semi-jarring tonal changes make it exciting</li>
							</ul>

						I would also recommend givng <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/you-will-never-know-why/329455551" target="_blank">You Will Never Know Why</a> and <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/velocity-design-comfort/299710177" target="_blank">velocity : design : comfort</a> a spin.

						Also, give Amputechture a listen! Tetragrammaton is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. The saxophane near the end made me tear up the first time I heard this.
