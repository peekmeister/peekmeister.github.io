			<h3>A connoisseur’s guide to Kanye West’s DONDA</h3>
			<div class="content">
				<div class="content-text">
					<p>
						So I don’t really have an authority on this subject since the album just came out and I’m still digesting it, but my mates suggested I write up a lil something about Kanye West’s newest album, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda_(album)" target="_blank">DONDA</a>.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						I guess I can start with a little history lesson, especially since Kanye has such a legacy that it’s near impossible to separate the art from the artist. If you don’t like him and don’t find his music good (or don’t really listen to it), then I can’t blame you for that, but factoring that in when listening to his music makes it all the more valuable and is part of the cult of Yeezy. But I will just give a brief run down for now.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Kanye's 9<sup>th</sup> album was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Is_King" target="_blank">Jesus is King</a>, his first “wholly” gospel album after making Christian songs since, well, his first single, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g" target="_blank">Jesus Walks</a>.  Regarding Jesus Walks, no radio station wanted to play a song about Jesus and he had been ignored by labels until he was in a near-fatal car crash and made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE8y25CcE6s" target="_blank">Through the Wire</a>, when people finally realized how committed and skilled Kanye was at this rap thing.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						He would go on to sprinkle religious songs throughout his discography, most notably the opener to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_of_Pablo" target="_blank">The Life Of Pablo</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oHdAA3AqnE" target="_blank">Ultralight Beam</a>. This turn to Christianity really isn’t anything new, but his commitment to the sound is. However, JiK was met with <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/kanye-west/jesus-is-king/" target="_blank">poor reception</a>. As an album, it’s all over the place, starting with a choral <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T58tRXzjC7c" target="_blank">Every Hour</a> and leading directly into a synth-heavy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CNPg2IQoC0" target="_blank">Selah</a>. It’s an odd mix of heavily produced songs with traditional gospel songs that almost works. I was personally burnt out due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Is_King#Background_and_recording" target="_blank">Yandhi</a>, the supposed 9<sup>th</sup> album that would act as a spiritual successor to my favorite Ye album, <a	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeezus" target="_blank">Yeezus</a>, being scrapped and leaked and sounding better than JiK. Like, songs that were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mrfu0FBB110" target="_blank">reused</a> sounded worse than the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzOVuUQxuWE" target="_blank">previous iterations</a>, and not just the lyrics, but the drums and other elements of the production were just neutered.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Anyway, I don’t have a problem with this album, especially if the follow up would be a refinement of what he brought to JiK. There was the Sunday Service Choir’s album, <a href="Anyway, I don’t have a problem with this album, especially if the follow up would be a refinement of what he brought to JiK. There was the Sunday Service Choir’s album, Jesus is Born, that I thought was a better 9th album, but it wasn’t technically Kanye so that doesn’t count. So does Kanye achieve this on his 10th album, DONDA? Yes, I think so." target="_blank">Jesus is Born</a>, that I thought was a better 9<sup>th</sup> album, but it wasn’t technically Kanye so that doesn’t count.

				<div class="content-text">
					<p>
						The soundscape Kanye makes in DONDA is a mix of religious motifs (organs throughout, choir very tastefully placed) in modern hip hop with snippets of the late Donda West talking about family sprinkled in for good measure and it… is just beautiful. However, the crux of the album is the tracklist and flow.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						These songs are great, but they’re disjointed and, unfortunately, there are a lot of them. The last 4 songs are just different versions of songs in the original 23 track run but with different verses and slightly different arrangements. TLOP is guilty of putting songs not a part of the album in the album, but those are bonus tracks and completely distinct songs. However, the issue is not just the bonus tracks tacked on at the end, but the album itself.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						To give a brief example, Listening Party 1 had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMjasXiIhiQ" target="_blank">Moon</a> immediately follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMjasXiIhiQ" target="_blank">Hurricane</a> and it sounds like that is the intention, carrying the same melody and similar longingly optimistic tones, but they were separated (and improved upon) in subsequent listening parties, which harms the album.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_Y6tThuw9I" target="_blank">Donda Chant</a> is good for the motif of the album, but leading into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IviYsgJXG5k" target="_blank">Jail</a> doesn’t really add anything. The first time we even hear Donda West is on track 6. Luckily, we got the version of Jail with Jay-Z, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IviYsgJXG5k" target="_blank">pt. 2</a> containing the DaBaby verse, but that really should not have been a consideration. In my discussions about the album, somebody said Jail is putting Kanye is a state of confinement and the proper ending of the album, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SsrVGHJvaA" target="_blank">Come to Life</a>, is him finding reprieve of all of the problems troubling him. But I hate this interpretation because it handwaves a bad tracklist and this is not a new story for Kanye and he finds his reprieve in the middle of the album on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9GXiQBUK4Y" target="_blank">24</a>, the original ending to the album. Why, then, do people (mostly them <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WestSubEver/" target="_blank">WSE boys</a>) insist that treating this album more like a musical automatically excuses any criticisms?
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						So my thoughts on this album are not about the cohesion of the tracks like they have been since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_See_Ghosts_(album)" target="_blank">KIDS SEE GHOSTS</a>, but about the separate tracks. I don’t like this in albums in general, but especially in Ye albums because of the stories presented in his albums before<a href="#donda_footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> and the stories his <em>albums</em> make (i.e. Ye’s legacy). The best examples of this are Yeezus and TLOP and those are some air-tight albums.
					</p>

						I really love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IviYsgJXG5k" target="_blank">Jail</a> and the floaty feeling it presents. I disagree that the omission of drums hurts the song. I like the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@spiritofthebear/video/7002220251999898886" target="_blank">versions people have made</a> with the drums at the end over the guitars, but I love what’s already there. I don’t love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIhdYj4tfFo" target="_blank">God Breathed</a>. Why does the first skip have to be so early? To be fair, it has some pretty cool samples.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbDMNjT-QpI" target="_blank">Off The Grid</a> sounds like the most accessible pop hit from the album in a good way. It’s a great song that has that brashness of Yeezus, or even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0U2QUGKbSE" target="_blank">Wash Us in the Blood</a>, and the appeal of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7FCgw_GlWc" target="_blank">Famous</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPjZmQAvk_8" target="_blank">Hurricane</a> is also a standout, with its reference track version <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1045415959551307776" target="_blank">first advertising Yandhi</a>, finally making it to a studio album, with a chorus from the Weeknd, verse from Lil Baby and improved synths from Mike Dean. It was supposed to be the lead single from this album, but, uh, Kanye rollouts. I do like some things about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64jp8gsmrL4" target="_blank">original version</a> better, but I try not to let that bias cloud my judgement too much.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sJZOGxRxwM" target="_blank">Praise God</a> has a lot of elements to be a great song. Vocals from Donda, verse from Travis Scott (almost taking the place of Wash Us in the Blood) but I don’t love it. And the next couple songs follow this trend. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4l85Qrnd-c" target="_blank">Jonah</a> sounds beautiful, but I also don’t mind skipping it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ94QQinn5o" target="_blank">Ok Ok</a> has a great verse from Lil Yachty, a <em>great</em> verse, but it’s another song that I don’t feel bad skipping.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						But I love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZET6hpfV-4" target="_blank">Junya</a>. Carti is great. The organs are beautiful. It’s a fun song. In a weird way, I think this is one of the strongest songs on the album. It’s not high art, it’s just fun. And leading directly into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp-O4eIUgf0" target="_blank">Believe What I Say</a>, first teased in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gta3o2G-Rbo" target="_blank">August 2020</a>, actually making it on the album after being absent from the first 2 listening parties? Let’s gooooo. But then it goes into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9GXiQBUK4Y" target="_blank">24</a>. 24 is a good song, but it feels like it was supposed to be the 24th track, like it was supposed to be in a <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1285813679510843394?lang=en" target="_blank">certain version of the tracklist</a>. On the other hand, it was the opener to the first listening party and I think it worked wonderfully for that! I think succeeding 2 high energy songs just doesn’t do this justice. You need time to breath, but something so grand shouldn’t be the breather.

					<p>
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMjasXiIhiQ" target="_blank">Moon</a> is beautiful and should be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9s6WecRmb0" target="_blank">following Hurricane</a>. But this was the moment that the listening party fully realized the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy" target="_blank">Divine Comedy</a>. That’s a long story, but it was a great moment and I don’t think that is captured in the album. It’s not earned after Remote Control! And also, going back to the point about viewing this as a musical, that’s not the point of the album. The experience of the listening parties was something I wish everybody could experience but the album is not a substitute for that.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofIluxP1nEU" target="_blank">Donda</a> is a good track, but also highlights one of the issues with this album. The end just…cuts off. I think there was a portion during the first two listening parties where Donda repeats “<a	href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAHhx4-3B_k" target="_blank">you never abandon your family</a>” that has been noticeably chopped. That may have been a separate track entirely, but the end of Donda still bothers me. Maybe you wouldn’t know that listening to it, but the abrupt ending into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5VYKkx7N-g" target="_blank">Keep My Spirit Alive</a> leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fmz2IjrQiWM" target="_blank">Jesus Lord</a> is one of the tracks people highlight as being one of the best songs, but I have to disagree. Even during the listening party, it bored me a bit because it’s a lot of the same sound. I don’t care much for lyrics and it’s a story song. It’s good and highlights <a href="https://www.thefocus.news/music/larry-hoover-kanye-west/" target="_blank">Kanye’s work with Larry Hoover</a>, but 9 minutes! 11 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzLbfkoztE" target="_blank">part 2</a>! I just need more production variation to excite me.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z2NpIh1gV0" target="_blank">Tell the Vision</a> is a good tribute to Pop Smoke, but it also doesn’t feel like it needs to be on this album, especially sandwiched between the bouncy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X74OxXravDo" target="_blank">New Again</a> and the ballad <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1JLaEBl7ik" target="_blank">Lord I Need You</a>. It feels like it would be better placed in the beginning with the other hip hop songs, but still, there's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7jsf2PeYB8" target="_blank">more complete version</a> on Pop Smoke's album that fits... somewhat better.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1nindf1meE" target="_blank">Pure Souls</a> is one of my favorites, incorporating organs and a jumpy beat. I want more of that. The next 2 songs are good, but a bit too slow for me. In some ways, I wish Pure Souls was the finale. I get the same message from this with the last two songs but it’s at least fun.
					</p>

						After all of this, what is there to takeaway from DONDA? Some argue that it’s a story of Kanye coming to terms with the bad things going on in his life, spanning from <a href="https://people.com/celebrity/donda-west-died-of-heart-disease-after-surgery/" target="_blank">his mother’s death</a> to the recent news of <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/02/19/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-file-for-divorce/?fbclid=IwAR2HOlMJYo9tzppYErlUMIlw9Lq9QHbI8SxC25NGJc-bOvOm4G3IHjqtyfk" target="_blank">his divorce with Kim Kardasian-West</a>. However, this story, sans the divorce, was already covered in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_(album)" target="_blank">ye</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_See_Ghosts_(album)" target="_blank">KSG</a>, as well as finding a conclusion in DONDA’s 24. This isn’t to say that finding solace once is the end all be all, but it’s just not new nor structured well. And these issues are so recent that they’re still a moving target. After Listening Party 3, it was reported that their divorce is <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/08/28/kim-kanye-divorce-working-on-relationship-privately-donda-show-wedding-dress/" target="_blank">not set in stone</a>, so great, glad we have an album so far removed from the late Donda West dealing with issues that will be void before the end of the year.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						This isn’t to say all albums have to be timeless. The Kanye that made Yeezus is no longer the Kanye making DONDA but Yeezus is still a fantastic album. The difference is Yeezus has a concise narrative that isn’t asking for nearly 2 hours of my time. Despite my issues with the tracklist, this is a dramatic improvement over JiK and has some fantastic songs that I dearly love.

						I thought the new Sweet Trip album was going to be the peak of the year, but Tyler, the Creator had to come and show me I'm wrong. Call Me If You Get Lost is great, I'd had it on repeat for days after it came out.
					</p>
					<p>
						I was a huge fan of Scum Fuck/Flower Boy and I was more excited than ever for his next album. I liked Igor, especially as time went by, but I was initially a bit underwhelmed by it because the narrative was so similar to that of SF/FB, being the natural progression of love and loss, but I wanted Tyler to do a hard rap album. And he finally delivered.
					</p>
					<p>
						Funnily enough, I wasn't too keen in the singles leading up to the albums release, as opposed to IGOR where I thought the singles were great and was ultimately a bit dissapointed. But the tone and setting the videos were setting up were perfect, and the opening track, SIR BAUDELAIRE, matched the subtly oppoulent and vintage feels of the roll out.
					</p>
					<p>
						The rest of the opening on the album is full of sub 3 minute songs that makes everything flow so seemlessly and nothing overstays its welcome. There's a clear identity to each song and the features bring their best to the track.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then we get the run of "deeper" songs, beginning with MASSA, which explicitly talks about Tyler's growth as a musician and a person. MANIFESTO has a great feature from Domo MFing Genesis with an old-style OF beat.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then the classic track 10 double song. I actually hadn't realized that the double song on each album has been track 10 on each album until I read a comment about it on the CMIYGL tracklist. But SWEET is a nice song, but the real treat is I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DANCE. Such a bittersweetly pleasant song.
					</p>
					<p>
						JUGGERNAUT has dummy drums. It may be closer to a throwaway in terms of the album's narrative, but it's my favorite. The features from Lil Uzi Vert and Pharrell are primo.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unfortuntely, I don't really like WILSHIRE (which is like 15% of the album) and closers (SAFARI or FISHTAIL) are passable, but I don't hate them.
					</p>
					<p>
						I did get the cassette box set and it came with a different closer (the aforementioned FISHTAIL) and it's okay. It's no BOYFRIEND, but it's a nice surprise nonetheless.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another thing I would like to bring up is the videos associated with the rollout. They do a good job of setting the tone and look beautiful, from a mix of shot comp, the coors used, and IT WAS SHOT ON FILM. Very subtle detail, but if you can tell, you can tell and it makes a difference. The graininess and overall texture makes the cinephile in me SQUEEEEEM.

						Right now, I am listening to <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sweet-trip/6949189" target="_blank">Sweet Trip</a>. In particular, their new album "A Tiny House, In Secret Speeches, Polar Equals". It's a mouthful, I know, but it's really lovely.

								<li><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/snow-purple-treasures/1566025467?i=1566025817" target="_blank">Snow Purple Treasures</a> - Starts very melodically and carries that melody through</li>
