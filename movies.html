				<h3>Wild Strawberries	(1957)</h3>
				<p>
						While I figure out how to use the Letterboxd API on Github, I'm just going to write some thoughts here (and likely use it in my Letterboxd reviews).
				</p>
				<p>
					My first exposure to Bergman was Summer with Monika, a Crtierion blind buy that was <em>pretty</em> good. Nothing spectacular, but it
					actually did hit me with some profound feelings about love, youth and innocence. I had a strong connection to it, but it still didn't "WOW" me, so I've been hesitant
					on more Bergman blind buys. Luckily, HBO Max has a good catalog of Bergman films so I can test the waters first.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have heard that, while Persona (1967) is possibly Bergman's greatest film, Wild Strawberries is one of the best introductions to Bergman. If it's not, I'm excited to see what is.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was immediately drawn into the life of Professor Isak Borg, as he recounts key moments of his life up until this point. The reason he is reliving these memories now is explained at the end: he feels a profound logic to the events
					occuring on the day of his honorary ceremony to make him the man that he is today. He is a crabby, rude man that has pulled himself by the bootstraps to become somebody noteworthy, somebody worth honoring.
					However, with the help of his daughter-in-law, he is forced to confront his ugliness and sees the generational affects of selfishness.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the key moments during this trip is a pit stop in a nearby town where the town praises Prof. Borg for how great of a man he was, which cracks his psyche to the tipping point, for after this, he experiences his first flashback to childhood
					and see's his then-fianc√©e share a devilish kiss with his younger brother.

					<h3>Before Sunrise (1995)</h3>
					<p>
						What a beautiful film about a blossoming relationship. Very organic and feels lived in. I would say the biggest fault is that Jesse acts so "American", with a somewhat unlikable, perhaps egoist attitude at times, and Celine falls head over heels for him.
						However, since I am not Celine and its not like she doesn't have her own faults, it's fine. And that may add to the uncertainty throughout the night, leading up to that end.
					</p>
					<p>
						There were so many technically-impressive scenes, either in single shots or scenes that would be hard to repeat for reshoots (pinball scene) that makes the relationship feel that much more realized.
					</p>
					<p>
						I recently had a discussion with a friend and he said that there's something that humans love about relationship stories with a timelimit. If you've experienced a similar relationship, you know how complicated - perhaps entertaining - they can be.
						The looming tragedy and shifting between fear and unconditional love.

					<h3>Speed Racer (2008)</h3>
					<p>
						I will write more on this later, but this is a stellar movie that I feel doesn't get talked about enough. It has a deserved cult following, but it's still an adaptation of a super recognizable anime by the legendary Wachowski sisters.
						Their filmography is not flawless, but Speed Racer should be recongized among the top. It's a visual tour-de-force that keeps the wit and spirit of the anime while making a compelling movie to boot.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						The CGI may look dated, but I would argue that that enhances the zanniness of the world. The characters act very exaggerated but it doesn't feel offensive or too much.
						So, while this is technically live-action, the people do not need to act grounded in this world.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						And in the same way that the Matrix is a trans allegory, I think Speed Racer is an autism allegory.
