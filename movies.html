				<h3>Wild Strawberries	(1957)</h3>
				<p>
						While I figure out how to use the Letterboxd API on Github, I'm just going to write some thoughts here (and likely use it in my Letterboxd reviews).
				</p>

					My first exposure to Bergman was Summer with Monika, a Crtierion blind buy that was <em>pretty</em> good. Nothing spectacular, but it
					actually did hit me with some profound feelings about love, youth and innocence. I had a strong connection to it, but it still didn't "WOW" me, so I've been hesitant
					on more Bergman blind buys. Luckily, HBO Max has a good catalog of Bergman films so I can test the waters first.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have heard that, while Persona (1967) is possibly Bergman's greatest film, Wild Strawberries is one of the best introductions to Bergman. If it's not, I'm excited to see what is.

					I was immediately drawn into the life of Professor Isak Borg, as he recounts key moments of his life up until this point. The reason he is reliving these memories now is explained at the end: he feels a profound logic to the events
					occuring on the day of his honorary ceremony to make him the man that he is today. He is a crabby, rude man that has pulled himself by the bootstraps to become somebody noteworthy, somebody worth honoring.
					However, with the help of his daughter-in-law, he is forced to confront his ugliness and sees the generational affects of selfishness.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the key moments during this trip is a pit stop in a nearby town where the town praises Prof. Borg for how great of a man he was, which cracks his psyche to the tipping point, for after this, he experiences his first flashback to childhood
					and see's his then-fianc√©e share a devilish kiss with his younger brother.
