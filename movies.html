			<h3>Fear Street Trilogy (2021)</h3>
			<div class="review-sect">
				<div class="review-text">
					<p>
						I want to talk about the Fear Street trilogy.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						There are a series of movies on Netflix that all debuted within a couple of weeks based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_Street">R.L. Stine book series of the same name</a> based on the mysterious case of local legend Sarah Fier and paranormal events happening in the town of Shadyside.
						Each movie takes place in a different year and plays around with the setting and representation of the genre to pay homage to different horror sub-genres and eras. This concept is immediately impressive and is delivered well. It does leave a lot to be desired, but it is a fun time regardless.

					<h3>Part 1</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						The first movie is subtitled "<a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse?jbv=81325689">Part 1: 1994</a>" and is supposed to be similar to movies akin to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer">I Know What You Did Last Summer</a>…I think. In many ways, it just feels like a modern movie in a “vintage” setting, akin to <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse?jbv=80057281">Stranger Things</a>. To be fair, they all do, but this one just feels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dSKUoV0SNI">Escape Room</a>…I think. I haven’t seen it. But it uses a lot of modern techniques and structures. Constant shaky cam, shot-reverse-shot dialog, integrating a lot of humor into the script, super stylized nostalgia-bait. That isn’t to say these are unique to present-day horror, but I feel like it’s everywhere.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						I would say this is the worst of the series, but it serves as a good foundation for what is to come. If it were just a few degrees more campy, it would be superb.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						However, it is paced pretty well. If memory serves, it all takes place over the course of one night and the pacing for that works very well. This is repeated throughout the series and it’s impressive how well it keeps things going. While not super campy, it still feels fun. There’s a scene at the end where they’re fighting these paranormal creatures and the lighting is just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eyUFAJ1xqo">neon lights in a dark room</a>, which is pretty and fun, but also felt a little too <em>easy</em>.
					</p>

					<h3>Part 2</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						A couple weeks later, the second movie, subtitled “<a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse?jbv=81334749">Part Two: 1974</a>” is released and follows the story of a survivor of the curse the party in part 1 are fighting. It’s a bit of a hamfisted way to tie everything together and it takes a bit too long just to start, and it’s got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qS85kvq8Xo">Britta</a> so how good can it really be? This one is supposed to be a summer camp horror movie like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th_(1980_film)">Friday the 13th</a>, full of teens having fun, having sex and having murder. This one expands on the curse and introduces some of the historic and cryptic areas of the Shadyside city that is the origin of all of the local horror stories.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						It falls in the same trap of perma-shaky cam, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UE3jz_O_EM">shot-reverse-shot</a>, constant expository dialog, but it improves on the first movie with by slowing things down a bit and being more flashy with the wardrobe. And they killed kids. Honestly respect the decision to be bold enough to show that.

					<h3>Part 3</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						In some ways, I hate Part 3 the most. But I also love it.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						It does to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witch_(2015_film)">the VVitch</a> vvhat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(2019_film)">Joker</a> did to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi_Driver">Taxi Driver</a>. It tries to take that setting and style and recontextualize it, which I think it does well and does horribly in a positively campy way. Subtitled “<a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse?jbv=81334750">Part Three: 1666</a>”, it takes place during the colonial era and brings back most of the main and supporting cast of the part 2 films. It achieves making the area feel like Shadyside, but it is also jarring. It feels like a high school production of a period drama and it’s byawtiful if you don’t take it seriously. I wish they used more of Sarah Fier’s original character actress in the flashback portion of the movie.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						This doesn’t achieve what it’s trying to do for me, but it can loop around to camp if you believe it does. This falls into the same pitfalls of the previous films, but I became aware of how many shots of very minor things happening with boring composition and music to drown out the scene because I’m such an ADHD riddled audience member that <a href="https://youtu.be/jM6PPxN1xas?t=247">I always need something to occupy the space</a>. There was a scene were “Sarah Fier” was sneaked in and drew her knife with violins blaring that really just looked boring. It really took me out of the movie and reminded me that this was made for a wide audience.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						There is a post ending scene that is mildly spoilery. But there’s a book responsible for all of these killings in Shadyside and the camera tracks the way to get there until somebody off screen takes the book, implying that there will be movies in the future. I was really really hoping it would end with R.L. Stine picking up the book but I suppose that would be too silly.
					</p>

					<p>
						So why do I want to talk about this series? It’s not particularly good, but it’s worth a watch. It has a strong hook but doesn’t carry it strongly. Each movie was directed by the same person, while I think this is the perfect concept to experiment with the creators, a la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V/H/S">V/H/S</a>. It paid homage to classic horror tropes but it still had that modern-sheen that feels inauthentic. Especially after having recently seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS6ksY8xWCY&t=6s">the Green Knight</a>, that - while is a different genre entirely - is shot beautifully and shows respect for the viewer. This can be done in horror, looking at fellow A24 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6wWKNij_1M">Hereditary</a>, or, uh, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQXmlf3Sefg">the WWitch</a>.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Ultimately, I am dissapointed with the final product, but I see the potential and want it to be done proper. Maybe if Janiak used different cinematographers for each movie, similar to what Kieslowski did with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Colours_trilogy">Three Colors Trilogy</a>. Maybe each movie can have a different level of camp and seriousness and really drive that home. I heard some people get that impression, with Part Three making them feel tense as opposed to spooked, but I felt quite the opposite. It did itself a disservice by the way it connected all of the movies together, but it wasn't the worst possible way of doing it.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						While it leaves much to be desired, I think it’s worth a watch. Maybe I'm just too spoiled with <a href="https://www.criterion.com/collection/598986">ultimate kino</a>, but I still really appreicate that it could be made. I would recommend not binging them too, but I hold that view with most things. I don’t like burning out on entertainment.

					<h3>Speed Racer (2008)</h3>
					<p>
						I will write more on this later, but this is a stellar movie that I feel doesn't get talked about enough. It has a deserved cult following, but it's still an adaptation of a super recognizable anime by the legendary Wachowski sisters.
						Their filmography is not flawless, but Speed Racer should be recongized among the top. It's a visual tour-de-force that keeps the wit and spirit of the anime while making a compelling movie to boot.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						The CGI may look dated, but I would argue that that enhances the zanniness of the world. The characters act very exaggerated but it doesn't feel offensive or too much.
						So, while this is technically live-action, the people do not need to act grounded in this world.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						And in the same way that the Matrix is a trans allegory, I think Speed Racer is an autism allegory.

					<h3>Before Sunrise (1995)</h3>
					<p>
						What a beautiful film about a blossoming relationship. Very organic and feels lived in. I would say the biggest fault is that Jesse acts so "American", with a somewhat unlikable, perhaps egoist attitude at times, and Celine falls head over heels for him.
						However, since I am not Celine and its not like she doesn't have her own faults, it's fine. And that may add to the uncertainty throughout the night, leading up to that end.
					</p>
					<p>
						There were so many technically-impressive scenes, either in single shots or scenes that would be hard to repeat for reshoots (pinball scene) that makes the relationship feel that much more realized.
					</p>
					<p>
						I recently had a discussion with a friend and he said that there's something that humans love about relationship stories with a timelimit. If you've experienced a similar relationship, you know how complicated - perhaps entertaining - they can be.
						The looming tragedy and shifting between fear and unconditional love.

				<h3>Wild Strawberries	(1957)</h3>
				<p>
						While I figure out how to use the Letterboxd API on Github, I'm just going to write some thoughts here (and likely use it in my Letterboxd reviews).
				</p>
				<p>
					My first exposure to Bergman was Summer with Monika, a Crtierion blind buy that was <em>pretty</em> good. Nothing spectacular, but it
					actually did hit me with some profound feelings about love, youth and innocence. I had a strong connection to it, but it still didn't "WOW" me, so I've been hesitant
					on more Bergman blind buys. Luckily, HBO Max has a good catalog of Bergman films so I can test the waters first.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have heard that, while Persona (1967) is possibly Bergman's greatest film, Wild Strawberries is one of the best introductions to Bergman. If it's not, I'm excited to see what is.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was immediately drawn into the life of Professor Isak Borg, as he recounts key moments of his life up until this point. The reason he is reliving these memories now is explained at the end: he feels a profound logic to the events
					occuring on the day of his honorary ceremony to make him the man that he is today. He is a crabby, rude man that has pulled himself by the bootstraps to become somebody noteworthy, somebody worth honoring.
					However, with the help of his daughter-in-law, he is forced to confront his ugliness and sees the generational affects of selfishness.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the key moments during this trip is a pit stop in a nearby town where the town praises Prof. Borg for how great of a man he was, which cracks his psyche to the tipping point, for after this, he experiences his first flashback to childhood
					and see's his then-fiancée share a devilish kiss with his younger brother.
