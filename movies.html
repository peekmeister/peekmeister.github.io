				<h3>Wild Strawberries	(1957)</h3>
				<p>
					While I figure out how to use the Letterboxd API on Github, I'm just going to write some thoughts here (and likely use it in my Letterboxd reviews).
				<br />
				<br />
				My first exposure to Bergman was Summer with Monika, a Crtierion blind buy that was <em>pretty</em> good. Nothing spectacular, but it
				actually did hit me with some profound feelings about love, youth and innocence. I had a strong connection to it, but it still didn't "WOW" me, so I've been hesitant
				on more Bergman blind buys. Luckily, HBO Max has a good catalog of Bergman films so I can test the waters first.
				<br />
				I have heard that, while Persona (1967) is possibly Bergman's greatest film, Wild Strawberries is one of the best introductions to Bergman
