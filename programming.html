						<p>
							In my sophomore year, we made an <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa" target="_blank">Amazon Alexa skill</a> for our data structures project. The reason behind our selection was that it sounded flashy and cutting-edge (because it is) and make an impression on the professors. We made a comment that since it was new, we could take it easy since professers wouldn't know how much work it would take to make. Silly us, because <em>we</em> didn't know how much work it would take as it was way less docuemented than any project up to that point. And silly me for doing the programming!
						</p>
						<p>
							We decided to make a game using the Alexa and wanted to design a game around the limitations of just voice. As you can imagine, we made a glorified text adventure game. We had some lofty ideas to take it to the next level, like having the Alexa wait extended periods of time before saying the next part. The premise was being stuck on a mountain and trying to reach civilization. I think the Alexa acted as a walkie-talkie/narrator, so if the troopers were searching for you, it would feel like a genuine search when they finally contacted you. Unfortunately, this was outside the scope of the Alexa unless you want to block use of the Alexa to <em>just</em> that app.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our planning and work sessions consisted of us writing the story and one of us *cough* me *cough* trying to code while inputting about the story and the limitiations of the tech. This used a tree data structure to traverse the story and create save points in <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>. At the time, none of us knew Node. Our professors didn't know Node. So it was a big ol' winging it effort. And I had to figure it out.
						</p>
						<p>
							I wanted to prove my worth so I wanted to do it myself but I could not figure out how to make the Alexa work. There was a virtual Alexa I could toy around with to make testing quicker, but I was just drawing blanks. I roped in another person in the group to help, but he couldn't figure it out either. I spent many hours trying to figure out how to just get it started. I figured out that the variable I was using was missing 2 member functions. After that, it worked beautifully. Everything was right except for that.
						</p>
						<p>
							This gave me the confidence to make a second Alexa skill to play during our class presentation where we started to describe the project until one of our members, sticking word-for-word to his script, activated the Alexa to introduce our project for us. It was cheeky and we all accidentally wore the same outfit and I got to get out of my shell!! This all leads up to my Hackers presentation, which I remember very dearly.
						</p>
						<p>
							It was too loud in the final test room and our grader couldn't hear the Alexa. We went into the hallway and she went down the wrong path. We got an A+.

						<p>
							Buckle up. This is a doozy.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is a project that makes me feel pretty good. Ethically questionable, but ultimately my work did not break any social doctrines or replace any jobs. I got to add on a lot to my experience and found a LOT of it engrossing.
						</p>
						<p>
							For my internship in university, I was given a deep-learning enabled camera - the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/deeplens/" target="_blank">AWS DeepLens</a> - to create a tool to use facial recognition to take daily attendance.
							This was a great opportunity to learn about machine learning and A.I., topics that fascinate me and always seemed too big to begin, get web dev experience and start to feel professional. However, the idea of building a tool to make sure everyone is going to class was unsettling.
						</p>

						<p>
							Regardless, I learned all about how AWS worked between 10 or so microservices. I used a model that excelled in facial recognition  - using the aptly named Amazon Rekognition - to load onto the camera, along with a little Lambda script telling the camera when to take the photos and where to send it (our specific S3 bucket).
							While the IoT device was resposible for reliably taking pictures, an additional Lambda script waits for an object to be created in that bucket and figure out who is in the picture. This used the same model from Rekognition to scan the face and compare it to values it had learned previously (of the class) and sends any matches to a Dynanmo database to be marked as present.
						</p>

						<p>
							This was the easy part, really. Once I got the camera at least. I wouldn't receive the DeepLens until a few weeks after starting in the position, so a lot of my time was getting familiar with AWS and the key AWS microservices for my project. However, this was only the first component.
						</p>

						<p>
							The second - and ultimately damning - part of the project was the website frontend. This tool would assist the Professor in taking attendance, who would have to go in and verify the results, maybe jot some notes on students to review later. This would use a new learning platform to hook up to the current learning platform (which was created by the same guy) to make seemless integration and create a strong LTI tool to promote the new system.
							So this would be the hub for the professor, so that they can see a history of attendance, make notes, perhaps see grades.
							AWS used this to send uncertain matches to to have the professor verify who was in the picture and retrain the model bit by bit. I had to learn PHP and a whole lot of web dev to do this and it was a lot of fun! I got really familiar with HTML and CSS as well as using PHP to make the website more programmatic.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, to use the new learning platform and actually test things out, I had to use a public Git repo. There was a lot to learn about connecting AWS to the site and using Amazon SNS to make it work and it was great. But, I ran into a problem updating the database from the website and I had hardcoded the keys into the site.
						</p>
						<p>
							To make a long story short, class research using this tool was nixxed. I did test this tool out within the office, across a wide range of ages, facial accessories and genders and it worked out decently well, though not perfect. I learned a lot about AWS and how it worked.

					<h2>ARM Assembly Hack</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="program-desc">
					<div class="program-text">
						<p>
							I'm very proud about this one. Our program focused primarily on high-level languages, so when our Computer Architecture class began teaching us the ARM Assembly language, a lot of us were blindsided, myself included. Luckily, work on this language started as group projects.
						</p>
						<p>
							My group was a great group of brilliant guys; in many ways I felt like the weakest member of the group. Luckily, we were all on the same page here and had trouble implementing the arithmetic functions, working with a limited number of registers to read and write data to and from. With enough grit and determination, we eventually got it. And, what do you know, our lynchpin for this project turned out to be me. I don't really know why, but I was able to get into the grove of managing the registers. It was reminiscent of a logic puzzle like the Tower of Hanoi.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anyway, that project went great. The next project was a bit more involved. We had to combine a few different types of programming to apply a filter to an image file and print it out. I did some complicated stuff to do this in ARM and it worked beautifully. However, we could only have groups of 2 and we couldn't just copy the code, so I had to make a SECOND version of the same project that performed the same operation differently that was more straight forward, but took 4 more clock cycles to complete. So, you know, the first one was the superior hack.

						<p>
							Now, Let me try to describe how this worked, regardless of your programming background.
						</p>
						<p>
							It would print out the first of 3 segments. This would be accomplished by making a counter and printing each sub-segment in the segment (a register could only contain so much information at once). Once the counter reaches 0, it will move on to print the second segment, otherwise it loops into itself.
						</p>
						<p>
							When it goes to print the second segment, it checks to see if a "dummy" register has the second segment loaded. It won't, so it will then load that segment into the dummy register and then continue to print that second segment following the same procedure as above.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now when it compares to see if the second segment is loaded into the dummy register, it will recognize that it is does indeed have that segment, so the program will now go to print the THIRD segment instead. There's another leftover register that can be loaded with that third segment and the third segment is printed like the 2 before it.
						</p>
						<p>
							I left something out when describing this algorithm. There's a check between the first dummy register and the leftover register each time to see if they contain the same information. It will often skip since that leftover register will only be containing some integer up to this point, and thus it can continue to print the picture. However, now that they are equal, the algorithm exits entirely.
						</p>
						<p>
							Why did I do this? Honestly, I can't remember what compelled me to do this, it just made sense. It kind of works backwards, since the registers can be "emptied" before running this algorithm, and running it will just load them with information. Similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi" target="_blank">Tower of Hanoi</a>, you can't just start by putting the base on the final rod, it just won't work. You have to work semi-backwards.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now, if that's the efficient way of doing it, how did I create a second algorithm that's a bit worse?
						</p>
						<p>
							It's more simple, but uses some elements of the Tower. The print function just prints. That is its only function. It tells it to print the next segment, not the second segment specifically. There's a separate function to figure out what the next segment is instead of baking that all inside of the second segment and having it fall back into that section.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's nothing super impressive, but I quite like how this project turned out.
